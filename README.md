# Cabo Card Game
This repository is a project to complete the functional programming course.

This branch is the main logic that defines the game using imperative approach. The game is not written using pure function (or so i hope so) and is just the main idea on how to write the actual game using functional approach in [main branch](https://github.com/mfasyas/cabo-card-functional/tree/main).
